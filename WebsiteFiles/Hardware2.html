										<p>This guide will provide an introduction to the design principles underpinning the drive and kicker systems. We will discuss the important principles of DC motors, and how to design a system to given specifications. As part of our engineering design process, we will demonstrate how to mathematically model some of your important design considerations. The ability to develop sound mathematical models is a core element of quality engineering design. Understanding how to model a system mathematically, and how to make reasonable assumptions, provides a solid foundation toward developing a physical system that meets your design requirements. The first element of our design process involves understanding DC motor curves, which can be used to determine some important design constraints.</p>


										<hr class="major pdf-exclude" />
										<h2>Understanding Motors</h2>
										<p>In this section we are going to discuss motor specifications and motor curves. We need to understand the basic motor specifications their translation to drawing motor curves. These motor curves will then be very useful in helping you select an appropriate motor for your application. The first motor specifications we are going to look at are the nominal voltage, the no load speed and the stall torque;</p>

										<ul>
											<li>The nominal voltage is the recommend voltage the motor should operate at. </li>
											<li>The no load speed is the maximum speed of the motor, calculated when no torque is applied to the output shaft, and when operating at the given nominal voltage.</li>
											<li>The stall torque is the maximum torque that can be outputted by the motor, however the output shaft will no longer be in rotation.</li>
										</ul> 

										<p>A motor's no load speed and the stall torque are typically given based on the specified nominal voltage. What these three specifications allow us to do is draw a torque vs speed graph, as can be seen in the following figure. We typically assume the relationship between torque and speed is linear.</p>


										<figure class="figure">
    										<img src="images/Hardware2/TorqueVsSpeed_1.png" width="50%" alt="Image Not Found" />
    										<figcaption>An Example of a Motor Torque vs. Speed Graph and how to use one</figcaption>
										</figure>

										<p>So how do you use this graph? Well, first if we know the required motor torque to move our robot (which we will calculate later in this guide), we can read off this graph to determine the speed of the motor at the required torque, assuming operation at nominal voltage. We do not have to operate our motor at its nominal voltage; we can supply a voltage that is higher or lower, we just have to be aware of possible operational changes. As you may know, the speed of a motor is directly proportional to the voltage applied to it. This is such that, in most cases, applying twice the voltage will double the speed. However, we must consider the low voltage alternative, since a motor does not necessarily start to spin the moment any voltage is applied. You probably have seen this in action; you need to supply above a certain voltage before the motor even starts to turn. This is because the motor needs to overcome its own internal forces before it will start rotating the output shaft. This voltage range prior to motor operation is what is known as the 'dead zone'. The following figure represents this idea graphically.</p>

										<figure class="figure">
    										<img src="images/Hardware2/SpeedVsVoltage.png" width="50%" alt="Image Not Found" />
    										<figcaption>All Motors Have a Dead Zone</figcaption>
										</figure>


										<p>High quality motors with good datasheets may specify the dead zone, however for less expensive motors they will typically not give you this value. You will therefore need to assume a threshold voltage, which may be anywhere between 20-50% of the nominal voltage.</p>

										<p>Now we can actually translate this dead zone threshold voltage onto the motor torque vs. speed graph. We can do this by making the assumption that the speed and torque are proportional to the voltage. This is such that if we halve the operating voltage then we will get half the torque and half the speed. So we can draw a line on our motor torque vs speed graph to represent the threshold voltage. This allows us to visualize the motor operating zone, as can be seen in the figure below.</p>

										<figure class="figure">
    										<img src="images/Hardware2/TorqueVsSpeed_2.png" width="50%" alt="Image Not Found" />
    										<figcaption>Adding the Threshold Voltage onto the Motor Torque vs. Speed Graph</figcaption>
										</figure>

										<p>We can use this graph similarly to the graph we examined earlier. If our required motor torque is plotted as a horizontal line, we can visually see what the motor's speed will be at various voltages (the voltage decreases as we move from the nominal voltage toward the y-axis). On the graph below we show two different required motor torque examples; you should notice one of our horizontal torque lines ends up in the dead zone and so we could not acheive low speeds.</p>

										<figure class="figure">
    										<img src="images/Hardware2/TorqueVsSpeed_3.png" width="50%" alt="Image Not Found" />
    										<figcaption>Two Examples of how to use a Motor Torque vs. Speed Graph to Determine the Possible Speed Range.</figcaption>
										</figure>

										<p>A motor can also operate above its nominal voltage, and we can add this to the motor torque vs. speed graph as well. However, you must be careful when operating at voltages significantly higher than the nonimal voltage or extremely close to the threshold voltage. Operating near these points can drastically reduce the lifetime of your motor. It can also destroy electronic circuits if they have not been designed to withstand these voltage levels and the high current induced by operating in these zones.</p>

										<p>Now that we understand the basic motor curves, and how we can generate them, we can start to look at designing our various systems.</p>
										
										<hr class="major pdf-exclude" />
										<h2>Designing a Drive System</h2>
										<h3>Design Requirements</h3>
										<p>Typically when designing a drive system we are trying achieve certain velocities and a minimum acceleration. To achieve these velocity and acceleration profiles, we need to consider our application and select appropriate motors, wheel sizes and a maximum robot mass. For this example we are going to be designing a medium-sized differential drive robot that will be used by researchers to perform outdoor place recognition experiments. The terrain will be mainly flat, and the researchers want the robot to be able to achieve a speed that is equal to or greater than human walking speed (5km/hr). You should also remember that the velocities and acceleration you need to factor into your design are dependent on the application.</p>

										<p>So first we need to define our operating velocities as well as our minimum acceleration. The researchers have provided us with the the minimum top speed which is approximately 1.5m/s. From this minimum top speed we can also reason a suitable minimum acceleration. We can do this by deciding how quickly we want our robot to be able to achieve this top speed. For this example, let's say it needs to reach 1.5m/s in 2 seconds; so we have a minimum acceleration of 0.75m/s^2. The final piece of the puzzle is the maximum low speed; we want our robot to be capable of moving at speeds below this threshold. Depending on your application, you may not need a maximum low speed, however for this example we do need to consider this factor as we want our robot to be able to move at speeds less than 0.2m/s.</p>

										<p>To recap we have decided on 3 engineering design requirements:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Minimum Acceleration: 0.75 m/s^2</li>
											<li>Minimum Top Speed: 1.5m/s</li>
											<li>Maximum Low Speed: 0.2m/s</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>Drawing a Free Body Diagram</h3>
										<p>The next step in our process is to draw a free body diagram. We are going to draw the side view of our differential drive robot and we are going to make the assumption the centre of mass of the robot is directly above the center of the wheel axle. From the free body diagram below, you can see that in our very simple model we only have two forces acting on the robot's wheels; the torque from the motor, and the force due to friction.</p>

										<figure class="figure">
    										<img src="images/Hardware2/FBD.png" width="50%" alt="Image Not Found" />
    										<figcaption>A Simple Free Body Diagram for a Differential Drive Robot</figcaption>
										</figure>

										<h3>Developing a Mathematical Model</h3>
										<p>We now need to develop a mathematical model of our drive system. This will involve using physics knowledge to somehow relate the forces in our free body diagram with our design requirements, allowing the selection of a suitable motor. To start, we need to remember Newton's second law: the cumulative force exterted on an object is equal to its mass multipled by its acceleration, or mathematically &Sigma;F = ma. From our free body diagram we can mathematically determine the required output torque for a desired acceleration: </p>

										<pre><code>&Sigma;F = m<sub>r</sub> * a
&tau;<sub>o</sub>&frasl;r<sub>w</sub> - F<sub>f</sub> = m<sub>r</sub> * a
&tau;<sub>o</sub> = (m<sub>r</sub> * a + F<sub>f</sub>) * r<sub>w</sub></code></pre>

										<p>Using our knowledge of physics, we can determine the frictional force. The force due to friction is a product of the normal force multipled by a coefficient of friction. If we assume the robot is operating on flat surface parallel to the ground, we can state that the normal force is equal to half the robot's mass times gravity. Why half the robot's mass? Well remember we have two drive wheels and we assumed the center of mass is directly above the wheels and halfway between them, so each wheel will "support" half the mass. Hence, we can say that the required output torque for a given acceleration is given by the following equation:</p>

										<pre><code>&tau;<sub>o</sub> = (m<sub>r</sub> * a + F<sub>f</sub>) * r<sub>w</sub>
&tau;<sub>o</sub> = (m<sub>r</sub> * a + &mu; * N<sub>f</sub>) * r<sub>w</sub>
&tau;<sub>o</sub> = (m<sub>r</sub> * a + &mu; * m<sub>r</sub> * 9.81&frasl;2) * r<sub>w</sub>
&tau;<sub>o</sub> = (m<sub>r</sub> * a + 4.905 * &mu; * m<sub>r</sub>) * r<sub>w</sub></code></pre>

										<p>Now, as engineers we are also aware of a little thing called loss. Throughout the drive system there are going to be losses. These losses could be due to heat, or noise, and caused by friction in the gears, or the shaft spinning within the wheel hub. Simply put, the power that we put in is not going to be the power we get out, and so we can model this as an efficiency factor. The required output torque is the torque we need at the wheel itself, which will only be a percentage of the torque supplied by the motor. Hence, mathematically:</p>

										<pre><code>&tau;<sub>output</sub> = &eta; * &tau;<sub>motor</sub></code></pre>

										<p>If we substitute this into our required output torque equation, and rearrange, we can obtain our final equation. This final equation specifies the required motor torque given a desired acceleration, and some design parameters such as wheel radius for a two wheel differential drive robot.</p>

										<pre><code>&tau;<sub>m</sub> = (1&frasl;&eta;) * ((m<sub>r</sub> * a + 4.905 * &mu; * m<sub>r</sub>) * r<sub>w</sub>)		# Equation 2.1</code></pre>

										<p>From the formulas above you can also see we require the mass of the robot, the radius of the robot's drive wheels, a coefficient of friction, and an efficiency. Obviously you do not currently have these, but they are what are sometimes referred to as design parameters. These design parameters are values that you may be able to change in order to tailor your design to the design requirements. For example, we could change the wheel radius, which would subsequently affect the acceleration and top speed of our robot. Additionally, some of these design parameters may become design requirements. For example, after performing all our calculations and selecting a motor we may consider the mass of the robot to be a design requirement; as in we must ensure the mass of robot does not exceed this value.</p>

										<p>We need to relate our velocity design requirements with our robot design parameters. In this case we do not need a free body diagram, we only need to know that linear velocity is equal to angular velocity multipled by the radius (v = &omega;r). So our minimum top speed and maximum top speed in terms of our design parameters are given by:</p>

										<pre><code>&omega;<sub>min</sub> = v<sub>min</sub> &frasl; r<sub>w</sub>						# Equation 2.2
&omega;<sub>max</sub> = v<sub>max</sub> &frasl; r<sub>w</sub>						# Equation 2.3</code></pre>
<!-- 
										<p>We should also add in a efficiency factor here because simply because the wheel is spinning does not mean the robot will move, this could be caused by something known as wheel slip.</p>

										<pre><code>&omega;<sub>min</sub> = (1&frasl;&eta;) * v<sub>min</sub> * r<sub>w</sub>					# Equation 1.2
&omega;<sub>max</sub> = (1&frasl;&eta;) * v<sub>max</sub> * r<sub>w</sub>					# Equation 1.3</code></pre> -->

										<h3>Choosing Initial Design Parameters and Calculating Motor Values</h3>
										<p>We will now work out 4 values, using Equations 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, that will help us select a motor. These values are:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>The motor torque required to overcome friction (i.e. acceleration equals 0). This is the required torque to maintain a given speed. We will call this the Friction Torque.</li>
											<li>The motor torque required to accelerate given our acceleration design requirement. We will denote this as the Acceleration Torque.</li>
											<li>The top motor speed. We will denote this as the Top Motor Speed.</li>
											<li>The low motor speed. We will call this the Low Motor Speed</li>
										</ul>


										<p>However, first we will need to choose some initial values for our design parameters. For this example we have selected the following:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Robot Mass: 10kg</li>
											<li>Wheel Radius: 0.04m</li>
											<li>Coefficient of Friction: 0.9</li>
											<li>Efficiency: 0.8</li>
										</ul>

										<p>Using these values alongside our design requirements we calculate the 4 values to be:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Friction Torque = 2.207 N</li>
											<li>Acceleration Torque = 3.13 N</li>
											<li>High Motor Speed = 37.5 rad/s</li>
											<li>Low Motor Speed = 5 rad/s</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>Selecting a Motor</h3>
										<p>We can now use the 4 values calculated in the previous section to help us select a motor. To start off with we are going to draw these as 2 horizontal and 2 vertical lines on a torque vs speed graph.</p>

										<figure class="figure">
    										<img src="images/Hardware2/DesignRequirementsGraph.png" width="70%" alt="Image Not Found" />
    										<figcaption>Calculated Design Values on Torque vs. Speed Graph.</figcaption>
										</figure>

										<p>So now we need to go traverse our favourite motor suppliers and attempt to find a suitable motor. In this example we went and found a DC brushed motor with the following characteristics:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Nominal Voltage: 24 V</li>
											<li>Motor Stall Torque: 3 Nm</li>
											<li>Motor No Load Speed: 450 RPM</li>
											<li>Stall Current: 5.8 A</li>
										</ul>

										<p>Using these values we can plot the nominal and threshold voltage torque vs. speed curves on the same graph as our calculated design values, see the figure below. Unfortunately, the motor datasheet did not state the threshold voltage or give us any information that allows us to approximate it, so we are going to set the threshold voltage to be approximately 40% of the nominal voltage.</p>

										<figure class="figure">
    										<img src="images/Hardware2/PoorMotorGraph.png" width="70%" alt="Image Not Found" />
    										<figcaption>Motor 1 Torque vs. Speed Graph with Overlaid Design Values.</figcaption>
										</figure>

										<p>From this graph the two critical points we first need to investigate are the intersection of the Friction Torque line with the Low and High Motor Speed lines. We need to ensure that these intersection points are within our operating zone. As we can see only our low motor speed intersection point is within our operating zone and this motor probably is not suitable for our application. While we could run the motors at a higher voltage to try and achieve the high motor speed; we would need to run them at approximately double the nominal voltage which would drastically reduce the motor's lifetime. However, from this graph we can intuitively see that well if we could get a motor with a bit more torque and a higher RPM we should be able to meet our design requirements. So we do some more searching and find the following motor:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Nominal Voltage: 24 V</li>
											<li>Motor Stall Torque: 6 Nm</li>
											<li>Motor No Load Speed: 650 RPM</li>
											<li>Stall Current: 16.7 A</li>
										</ul>

										<p>Plotting this motor's torque vs. speed graph and overlaying the calculated design values we can see that this motor could be suitable, the figure is below. The first thing we notice is that our friction torque line intersects with our high and low motor speed lines within the operating zone. This means that the motor should be able to achieve our desired minimum and maximum forward velocities. The next thing we shoud take note of is that our acceleration torque line is well below the stall torque, so we should be able to achieve our desired minimum acceleration. While this motor appears to be suitable for our application our low motor speed and friction torque intersection point is quite close our threshold voltage. This means that if our models and assumptions are slightly off then we may not be able to achieve our desired low forward velocity.</p>

										<figure class="figure">
    										<img src="images/Hardware2/SuitableMotorGraph.png" width="70%" alt="Image Not Found" />
    										<figcaption>Motor 2 Torque vs. Speed Graph with Overlaid Design Values.</figcaption>
										</figure>

										<p>Okay so we have now selected our motors, what next? Well next we would need to ensure that the weight of the motor and its stall current are suitable for our system. If they are, we would then need to go design the motor driver circuitry in order to control this motor. A tip for when you go select a H-Bridge IC, make sure you get a H-Bridge with in-built under voltage, over current and over temparature protection it may cost you a little bit more but it will save you a lot of issues. Additionally, make sure the H-Bridge can handle more than the stall current specified by the motor.</p>


										<h3>What About Omnidirectional Drive Systems</h3>
										<p>Designing for a omnidirectional drive system uses the same process as a differential drive system. However, we need to account for the fact the wheels are angled when determining the high and low motor speeds. The simplest way to do this is to use the kinematic equations for your omnidirectional drive system and substitute your desired forward velocity. By doing this we can get the required wheel speeds to achieve this desired forward velocity. For example, the kinematic equations for 3 omnidirectional drive system wheeled system are:</p>

										<figure class="figure">
    										<img src="images/Hardware2/OmniKinematics.png" width="70%" alt="Image Not Found" />
    										<figcaption>Kinematic Equations for a 3 Omnidirectional Drive System.</figcaption>
										</figure>

										<p>If we wanted to be able to move with a forward velocity of 1m/s (i.e. |V| = 1, &theta; = 0 and &alpha; = 0) then we calculate the wheel velocities to be -0.866, 0, and 0.866 m/s for the 60&deg;, 180&deg; and 300&deg; wheel respectively. You may be wondering hold up how can my robot move faster than my angled wheel. SOMETHING HERE WITH DIAGRAM TO EXPLAIN WHY</p>

										<p>However, this means that we need an additional amount of torque. How much extra torque do we need? Well it will be equal to approximately 15%. So you would compute your friction and acceleration torques as you would for a differential drive and then add on an extra 15%. Remember this is only for a 3 wheel omnidirectional system, for a 4 wheel system it is different.</p>


										<hr class="major pdf-exclude" />
										<h2>Kicker Design</h2>
										<p>To design a kicker we need to develop a mathematical model. We can then use this mathematical model to help us select certain components and properties of the kicker system. Before we start developing a mathematical model we need to understand what quantity are we trying to model and what quantities we know or we can choose. For a soccer bot kicker system we are trying to design for a required ball velocity, and our known quantites, or ones that we can choose, are the mass of the ball, the mass of the kicker plate, and the force that we can apply to the kicker. So we need develop a mathematical model that represents the ball velocity in terms of these quantites; there may be some others that appear while we develop the equation.</p>

										<p>To start designing our mathematical model we need to assume that the collision between the kicker plate and the ball is elastic. You could assume that it is an inellastic collision but that makes it much harder. In an elastic collision both momemtum and energy are conserved. Furthermore if we assume that only kinetic energy is transferred during the collision and that there are no other forms of energy present, such as heat or noise, then we can write the following equations:</p>

										<pre><code># Conservation of Momentum
m<sub>k</sub>v<sub>ki</sub> = m<sub>k</sub>v<sub>ki</sub> + m<sub>k</sub>v<sub>b</sub>				# The initial velocity of the ball is 0,  that is why it is removed from the LHS 

# Conservation of Enery
E<sub>ki</sub> = E<sub>kf</sub> + E<sub>b</sub>				
0.5*m<sub>k</sub>v<sub>ki</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.5*m<sub>k</sub>v<sub>kf</sub><sup>2</sup> + 0.5*m<sub>k</sub>v<sub>f</sub><sup>2</sup> 		# Remember that kinetic energy = 0.5*m*v<sup>2</sup>

# Where
v<sub>ki</sub> = the velocity of the kicker right before impact
v<sub>kf</sub> = the velocity of the kicker after the impact
v<sub>b </sub> = the velocity of the ball after the impact
m<sub>k </sub> = the mass of the kicker
m<sub>b </sub> = the mass of the ball
</code></pre>

										<p>We can then perform simultaneous equations to remove the unknown and unwanted term of v<sub>kf</sub>. We can leave the v<sub>ki</sub> in for now as we can change this into known quantities later on. The result of performing simultaneous equations leads to the following equation (we are not going to show the derivation):</p>

										<pre><code>v<sub>b</sub> = (2m<sub>k</sub> * v<sub>ki</sub>) / (m<sub>k</sub> + m<sub>b</sub>)		# Equation 3.1</code></pre>

										<p>The final step in developing our mathematical model is to substitute the velocity of the kicker right before the collision (v<sub>ki</sub>) into known quantities. Well using one of the equations of motion we can find the v<sub>ki</sub> in terms of its mass, the force applied to the kicker plate and the distance the kicker plate travels.</p>

										<pre><code># Equation of Motion
v<sub>ki</sub><sup>2</sup> = v<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2ad

# Newton's Second Law
F = m<sub>k</sub>a<sub>k</sub>

# Assuming the kicker plate starts at rest then v<sub>0</sub> and subsituting we find
&radic;(v<sub>ki</sub>) = &radic;(2Fd &frasl; m<sub>k</sub>)
</code></pre>

										<p>We can then substitute this into equation 2.1 to find the velocity of the ball after the kick given the mass of the kicker plate, the mass of the ball, the force applied to the kicker and the distance the kicker plate travels prior to kicking the ball.</p>

										<pre><code>v<sub>b</sub> = (2m<sub>k</sub> * &radic;(2Fd &frasl; m<sub>k</sub>)) / (m<sub>k</sub> + m<sub>b</sub>)</code></pre>

										<p>This is a starting point to a mathematical model for a kicker system. Depending on the style of kicker system you wish to design the mathematical model of the force applied will change. This is something you are going to have to investigate yourself but the teaching team are here to help. However, one of the most important things when designing a kicker is to perform impedance matching. 

										<p>Impedance matching is when you match the impedance of your output with the impedance of your input to maximum power transfer. For a kicker system matching impedances means ensuring that the mass of the kicker plate equals the mass of the golf ball. To demonstrate this we can use the mathematical model developed and plot a graph of ball velocity vs kicker mass assuming a constant force is applied. If you do this you will get a graph like the figure below. As you can it as a distinctive peak. This peak occurs when the mass of the kicker matches the mass of the ball.</p>

    										<figcaption>We need to Match the Impedance to Achieve Maximum Kicking Velocity.</figcaption>
