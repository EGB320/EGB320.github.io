											<h1>Raspberry Pi GPIO and Python Tutorial</h1>
										</header>							

										<!-- <p>This tutorial provides an introduction to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins, and how to interface with them using python 3. 
										</p> -->

										<h2>Overview</h2>
										
										<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0;">To complete your soccer bot project, you will need to use the Raspberry Pi general purpose input/output (GPIO) pins. The programming language you use to communicate with the GPIO pins is up to you, however this tutorial will be written using python 3. 

										The GPIO pins are a physical interface between the Pi and all external connections. The Raspberry Pi has 40 pins which can be accessed. These are as follows;
										<ul style="margin-left: 35px; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px">
											<li> 26 GPIO pins</li>
											<li> 12 power pins (split between 5V, 3.3V and Ground)</li>
											<li> 2 eeprom pins</li>
										</ul>
										Over the course of this semester, you will become quite familiar with the GPIO pin layout presented below (your RPi 3B has this same configuration).

										</figure>
										A more detailed representation is described here, with the pin numbers and functions listed next to each pin. The pin names according to the BCM naming convention are listed next to each pin, while the BOARD naming convention refers to the raw pin numbers presented at the far left and right of the image. For example, the bottom pin, listed as GPIO21 and pin# 40, is referred to as 21 under BCM convention, or 40 under BOARD convention.

										<h2>GPIO Activity</h2>
										<h3 style="padding: 0px; margin-bottom: 3px; margin-top: 3px">Required Components</h3>
										<p style="padding: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px">To help you learn how the GPIO pins work, the following example will step you through the process of controlling an LED with the Raspberry Pi. To complete this example, you will need the following;
										<ul style="margin-left: 35px; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px">
											<li> 1 LED</li>
											<li> 1 330ohm resistor</li>
											<li> 1 breadboard</li>
											<li> 2 male to female jumper cables</li>
											<li> 1 right-angled header</li>
										</ul>
										
										<h3 style="padding: 0px; margin-bottom: 3px; margin-top: 3px">Connecting the Hardware</h3>
										First, we must connect the LED to the raspberry pi. If you are currently using the provided screen, you will need to disconnect the screen and connect your right-angled header in order to access the required pins. The right-angled header needs to be aligned to cover pins 29-40, inclusive. In this example, we will be using pin 21 and the ground pin located directly next it, so you will need to plug a jumper cable into each of the corresponding pins in the right-angled header.

	    										<figcaption>Raspberry Pi Pin Setup for LED Activity</figcaption>
										</figure>
										Using your breadboard, wire up the LED and resistor as shown below. THE FOLLOWING NEEDS TO BE UPDATED!!!!!!!! The red cable shown below should connect your GPIO pin to your LED. The black cable should connect the ground pin to the unattached end of your resistor.

										</figure>
										Now reattach your HDMI screen, and connect your Raspberry Pi to the power supply. Attach a USB keyboard and mouse to the Raspberry Pi. 
										<h3 style="padding: 0px; margin-bottom: 3px; margin-top: 10px">Programming Using GPIO</h3>
										Now that you have connected an LED to your Raspberry Pi, the next step is to write some software to control the input and output signals sent from the Pi to the LED circuit. In this example, we will write our script using Spyder, however you may use any text editor and terminal emulator you like to write and run your scripts.

										Open Spyder by either entering the command line input;

										<pre style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px"><code>spyder</code></pre>
										or by clicking the shortcut on your desktop.
										
										The following example code should get you started with interfacing between the Raspberry Pi and an LED connected to pin 21;

										<pre style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px"><code>import RPi.GPIO as GPIO			# Import the GPIO module
import time 				# Import the time module
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)			# Set the GPIO pin naming convention to BCM
GPIO.setup(21,GPIO.OUT)			# Set up GPIO pin 21 as an output
GPIO.output(21,GPIO.HIGH) 		# Set GPIO pin 21 to digital high (on)
time.sleep(5)				# Wait for 5 seconds
GPIO.output(21,GPIO.LOW)		# Set GPIO pin 21 to digital low (off)</code></pre>
										Run your script by clicking the green arrow "play" button at the top of the Spyder UI. The expected output from the program is an LED which turns on for 5 seconds, then turns off.
